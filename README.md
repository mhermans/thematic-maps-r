**Workshop material "Show & tell: making thematic maps in R"**

This repository contains all the material for the workhop "Show & tell: making thematic maps in R", presented at [HIVA - KU Leuven, 11th and 14th of February 2019](https://mhermans.net/talk/2019-02-11-r-thematic-maps/).

The material presented at the workshop can be **browsed online**: [Making thematic maps with R](https://workshop.mhermans.net/thematic-maps-r/). The material in this repository is structured in [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), which can be adapted to your needs and regenerated for an new version of that site. It is also reused in other workshops I presented, for example on [making thematic maps with historical data](https://mhermans.net/talk/2019-12-11-r-historical-maps/).

Feel free to (re)use, adapt and share (GNU GPL V3.0). I'm always [happy to hear from you](https://mhermans.net/#contact) if you do, or if you have questions, are interested in hosting a workshop, etc.
